# Shock Construction

Analyzing information inattentions requires some form of quantification. We follow the exogenous shock literature within the field of Macroeconomics, where a measure is constructed that represents new information that are orthogonal to the current set of information.

We do not outline the exact way of the quantification but summarize the resulting variables that are used in the analytics section to identify the effect of information inattentions.
